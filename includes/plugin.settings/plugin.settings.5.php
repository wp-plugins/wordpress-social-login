Keep in mind I'm a busy man and providing customer support is not my cup of tea.

If I did not answer your question or I took too long to, then its either :
   * I didn't understand it, 
   * It has been asked before on the google group or wordpress forum,
   * Your "question" is too stupid,
   * I'm simply too busy or hibernating irl,
   * also, be friendly, questions and requests containing hi, hello and thank you 
     can make a diffrence :P.
